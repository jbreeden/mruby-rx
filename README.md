# Rx

Rx is intended to provide a high-level observable-based API for [mruby-libuv](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-libuv).

The observables used here are inspired by the reactive extensions (specifically rxjs 5).

## Dependencies

- Runtime: Just [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) and [mruby-libuv](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-libuv).

## Building

Make sure you're familiar with the [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) build process, then setup your build_config.rb file [like this](./build_config.rb).
